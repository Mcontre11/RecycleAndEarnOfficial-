## How It Was Made
this project was made using html, css, bootstrap JS, Node.js, Express, Mongo DB

## Lessons learned 
Lessons learned from this project is to fully understand documentations before implementng code. I used the scanners from Quagga and Serratus. 
I also learned to be strategic in the way I name the files, objects, properties, functions etc.. because it can be harder to understand in the long run and can also cause bugs in the code.
